TODOs for Automeasure code
-----------------------------------

This is a list of TODOs compiled from emails I recieve about the automeasure package.  States of TODOs can be PENDING, WORKING (if I am working on them) and DONE.

(1) PENDING
Improve commenting in subroutine expand_windows_with_stalta_limited(), especially concerning how the criteria amp_factor, max_height, t_fac etc. work.

(2) PENDING
Insert "implicit none" statements for all subroutines / functions in the code, and fix resulting problems.

(3) DONE
Fix GMT script plot_seismos_with_adjoints.sh to accpet DT=0s adjoint sources.

(4) DONE
Next, we will need a code that does this: Given a set of windows and 
records, compute the misfit function.  This will be needed for the test 
model in the CG algorithm.  In other words, pick the windows for model 
m^k, then use those same windows for model m^k_t.  
Requires:
	(a) Increased modularity of existing code (DONE)
	(b) A read_win_quality routine (DONE)
	(c) A simple bit of code that reads a win_quality file and two
seismograms, and spits out a new win_quality file with the new misfits
using the old windows.  (DONE)

(5) PENDING
For the plotting options, I would think it'd be nice to have a script
that generates two pairs of seismograms for each record: data vs m^k and
then data vs m^k_t, along with the DT for each.
