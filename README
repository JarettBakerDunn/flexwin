Welcome to the automeasure package.  The purpose of this package is to
enable automated measurement of the differences between data and 3D
synthetics.  

This is only a bare-bones instruction set for the time being.  Better
instructions will come along, I promise.

COMPILATION
----------
Compilation _should_ be as simple as typing :

make

You should end up with an executable (test_code_xcor) and links to two binary
files (iasp91.hed and iasp91.tbl) that contain the iaspei-91 traveltime
information.  The program currently requires the iasp91 files (or links to
them) to be present in the directory from which the code is launched (this
behaviour can be changed if required).

RUNNING
------
./test_code_xcor < input

where the "input" file is as follows:

327
RAW_DATA/9627721.CI.ADO.BHR.sac.d.fil
SYNTH/ADO.CI.BHR.new.fil
MEASURE/ADO.CI.BHR
RAW_DATA/9627721.CI.ADO.BHT.sac.d.fil
SYNTH/ADO.CI.BHT.new.fil
MEASURE/ADO.CI.BHT
RAW_DATA/9627721.CI.ADO.BHZ.sac.d.fil
SYNTH/ADO.CI.BHZ.new.fil
MEASURE/ADO.CI.BHZ
....

i.e. the number of traces to be measured, followed by (in order) the path to
the raw data sac file, the path to the synthetic sac file and the path and
basename for the (many!) output files for that trace.  


OUTPUT FILES
-----------
All trace-specific outputfiles are written by one of two subroutines in
seismo_subs.f90 : write_seismos_gmt OR write_measurements_gmt.  The first
subroutine writes out all the windowing information, the second
writes the measuremnts and adjoint sources.  All output files are in
ascii.  All file names start with the basename given in the input file for
that trace:

basename.obs		= observed seismogram (lowpassed)
basename.syn		= synthetic seismogram (lowpassed)
basename.env.obs	= envelope of observed seismogram (lowpassed)
basename.env.syn	= envelope of synthetic seismogram (lowpassed)
basename.win		= list of windows with theoretical phase arrival times
basename.win.qual	= list of windows with F1,F2,Tshift,dlnA values before and after measurement
basename.phases		= theoretical arrival times of phases
basename.stalta		= STA/LTA timeseries used to select the windows
basename.info		= information on the path and some statistics

basename.dtau.n		= dTau information (as fn of freq) for window n
basename.dlnA.n		= dlnA information (as fn of freq) for window n
basename.seis.win.n	= synth, obs and reconstructed obs for window n
basename.adj.win.n	= adjoint source for window n

For details about the file formats, your best bet is to read the write_ subroutines in seismo_subs.f90


PLOTTING
-------
Several plotting routines (plot_*.sh) are provided as examples for
plotting seismograms, measurements and adjoint sources.  All plotting is
done in gmt.  These scripts will need to be modified to suit your
particular plotting needs.

The script extract_event_windowing_stats.sh extracts statistical
information on the window selection process, on the measurements.  Again,
you can use use this script as a template for your own information
extraction needs.

PACKAGE CONFIGURATION
--------------------
The package in svn is (currently) pre-configured for scsn measurement.  All configuring is done in two files:
user_functions.f90
user_parameters.f90

The parameters that can be configured are:
* WIN_LP_PERIOD : the low-pass cutoff applied to the seismograms before window selection of measurement
* DLNA_BASE : a constant limit of dlnA for window acceptance
* TSHIFT_BASE : a constant limit of tshift for window acceptance
* F2_BASE : a constant limit of F2 for window acceptance
* STALTA_BASE : a water level that controls the definition of windows (this should not really be changed much, if at all)
* DEBUG : a logical flag to indicate whether debugging information should be output or not (this flag does not do much at the moment)

The user_functions.f90 file describes how the window selection /
acceptance parameters vary with time.  This feature allows the
seismologist to finely tune the picking criteria using information about
the path, the event and any other a-priori knowledge.  The current
configuration of this file (for scsn data) allows for varying the dlnA and
Tshift limits depending on whether the window is in the "Pnl" regime or
the "SW" regime (limits and regimes are as described in Qinya's
inversion.txt file).  It also allows for changing the sta/lta water level
with time (for example to make it much harder for late arriving phases to
be picked).

In order to use this algorithm on a different dataset (global, short
period, etc.), both the user_functions.f90 and the user_parameters.f90
must be edited accordingly.

NOTE: FOR THE NEW SETTINGS OF USER_FUNCTIONS AND USER_PARAMETERS TO TAKE
EFFECT YOU MUST FIRST "MAKE CLEAN" to remove the .mod files, AND THEN RECOMPILE (MAKE).
